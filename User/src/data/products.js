        question: "What is the difference between the Pro and Lite models?",
        answer: `The Pro model is our flagship diffuser, designed for maximum light control and professional-grade results. It features adjustable settings for varied lighting environments and is built with more robust materials for extensive use. The Lite model, on the other hand, is more compact and lightweight, offering a simpler setup ideal for photographers who prioritize portability. It delivers excellent diffusion for casual or on-the-go shooting. The Lite model has a max. recommended flash power of 1/4 where for the Pro we recommend 1/8 max. flash power. In Pro models, the internal diffusion material is one stop less than that of the Lite. This means with Pro models you can get a slightly higher guide number/power.`,
